## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The app follows an **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architectural pattern, separating concerns into distinct layers:

* **View (Composables):** The UI layer, responsible for observing `ViewModel` states and rendering the user interface. It sends user events back to the `ViewModel`.
* **ViewModel:** Exposes **`StateFlow`s** for UI observation, handles UI logic, and interacts with the `Repository` to fetch or persist data.
* **Repository (`MovieRepository`):** An abstraction layer that handles data operations, providing a clean API for the `ViewModel` regardless of whether data comes from a remote API, local database, or preferences. It typically orchestrates data sources.
* **Data Layer (Models, APIs, Local Storage):** Contains data models, network service interfaces (Retrofit), and local data sources (e.g., for favorites).

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/movie-catalogue-app.git](https://github.com/your-username/movie-catalogue-app.git)
    ```
    (Replace `your-username/movie-catalogue-app.git` with your actual repository URL)
2.  **Open in Android Studio:**
    Open the cloned project in Android Studio (Jellyfish | 2023.3.1 or newer recommended).
3.  **Obtain an API Key:**
    This application requires an API key from The Movie Database (TMDB).
    * Go to [The Movie Database (TMDB) API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) and sign up for an account.
    * Generate a new API key.
    * Create a `local.properties` file in the root of your project (same level as `build.gradle.kts` files).
    * Add your API key to `local.properties` like this:
        ```properties
        TMDB_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
        ```
        (Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual TMDB API key)
4.  **Build and Run:**
    Sync the project with Gradle files and run the app on an Android emulator or a physical device.
